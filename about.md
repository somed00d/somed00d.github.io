# About

I've been on Twitter a long time and my focus has jumped all over the place, but it tends to center around computers and criminals. It first started long ago with *infosec* which got me curious about the [dark web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web). By this time the first [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)) marketplace had already been shut down, but the second was alive and well. It was at this point that I started to become curious about [operations security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security). At the same time I was also turning into more of a news junkie. One of the first large events I remember following closely via social media was the [Israeli-Palestinian conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict). Around then was when I discovered [@thegrugq](https://twitter.com/thegrugq). We're talking the [Brown Moses](https://twitter.com/EliotHiggins) days here, when people were starting to use social media to connect the dots better. This all led me to discovering [@switch_d](https://twitter.com/switch_d), who got me thinking about the convergence of social media with terrorism. The [Syrian civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war) started really coming into focus on Twitter and the [Islamic State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant) was rising.

It was then that I became fascinated by the usage of computers by criminals. Not only did we have guys over on the dark web selling drugs, but we had actual terrorists on Twitter. I also started to get a sense of how social media could be used as a way to bypass traditional media outlets and get information straight from sources on the ground. Further how such information could be analyzed and investigated to produce open source intelligence.

Eventually the [2016 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election) happened, another event heavily involving the Internet. My focus shifted to learning about [disinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation) campaigns taking place on social media. Disinformation was a common occurrence in Syria and so things in a way started to converge for me. It brought together all the cyber criminal stuff with the nation state participating in information operations, plus a couple dashes of national security. 2016 also spurred masses of people using the Internet and social media crowd sourcing to dig through open source information, really taking it all mainstream. By this time [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/) was well established, but still a lot of the focus before 2016 had been on conflicts. Now we found ourselves surrounded with disinformation from a mixture of criminal and nation state with social media being the main stomping grounds. Things were exciting to say the least.

Throughout this period I kept an interest in the dark web and the ways it continued being utilized by criminals. We had seen blips of overlap with terrorism but for the most part it was still focused on cyber criminals, drug dealing... and child abuse material. I spent a year following 2016 focused solely on researching sex offender communities that exist on the dark web. That eventually included also how social media is used for exploitation and sextortion. That was all difficult work and I'm discouraged looking at where things are these days with regard to it. I hope one day to be able to talk more about it and become involved again.


My focus at the moment is drug trafficking, but more specifically how drug trafficking organizations in Mexico and elsewhere use the Internet. I'd always had hopes of starting my own website, something that brought together things I'd learned from past adventures. After getting all my marbles in order, I started [narco.news](https://narco.news) towards the beginning of the year with that mission in mind. That's as far as we've gotten in this dude's *Book of Life*. Where it leads next is anyone's guess!
