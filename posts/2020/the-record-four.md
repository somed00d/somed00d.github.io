I guess our record is four, four days of writing in a row. Hopefully we'll be able to beat that haha. I keep telling myself that I will write these earlier in the day but you know how that goes. It's all good, I'm hopeful that more productive habits will build as time goes on. The good news that I've been spending a lot of time writing. I probably spent way to much time working on that piece but so be it. Getting through long pieces like that is good practice because it really requires staying organized. I'm still unsure about some things but I'll sleep on it. Like I have tweeted, you just have to accept that a lot of your stuff in the beginning isn't going to be as good as you want it to be. But that with persistence and hard work improvement will come.

I was exhausted last night and I'm exhausted tonight.
