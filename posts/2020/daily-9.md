Not much to say today—it wasn't the best of days. Maybe that is to be expected since the last couple days haven't been so bad. I've found life often enforces a balance, whether you like it or not. Thus it's important to really enjoy the good days and not beat yourself up too much on the bad ones. That is at least what you're supposed to do. I think it can be harder when you suffer from depression because the bad days can feel never-ending. Though the pandemic really has in many ways made everyone take a step back and consider what constitutes a *bad* day. With so much death and suffering it can be hard at times living in the first world to justify your own suffering that doesn't seem as detrimental. Being me, I often will think in the extremes. There were times during the Syrian civil war where I'd manage to shake my depression for the day because I had seen imagery of dead children on social media. Thinking something like, "How can I feel horrible over what really is not the end of the world when these poor children just got bombed to pieces." I wouldn't advise it a healthy way to deal with your own feelings of misery. But it helped me some days. That is the extreme, but a similar thing happens with the pandemic. Being safe and healthy right now is a luxury. While it is at times miserable sitting here all day, it is only fucking sitting here all day. It's a fucking far cry from any sort of genuine misery. But depression. That is what can make it feel like a never-ending void.

Though I guess for me, it is the *extreme* reality that helps snap me out of that void, albeit in a sometimes unhealthy way. At times all that matters is getting out of that void, in whatever way works for you.

This is all on my mind because today I saw a picture of a dead child in Mexico this morning. The child had been gunned down yesterday while standing alongside two men, one of which was also killed. I see pictures of mutilated corpses every day—thankfully this one was not—so it's not that that bothers me. But the obvious, a child, one that is dead. It was a girl. She was only eight years old. I don't even know her name because the press didn't say.

It's hard to write about that stuff. You don't want to tell people about it because who wants to hear about a dead child. It's almost a way to automatically ruin someones mood and I don't feel I've the right to do that to someone. At the same time, it feels like if you don't write about it then their memory is forgotten.

So yeah, today wasn't great. But I can only complain so much. I'm fortunate to get to try again tomorrow.
