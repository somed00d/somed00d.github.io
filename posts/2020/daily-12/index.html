<p>Super late and not much to say. These haven't felt as productive lately because I don't feel like I've had much to say. I'm going to try to be more focused in what I talk about instead of just kind of ranting about what's going on in my mind that day. Maybe I'll pick one topic or a word. I think that will provide more organization. Sometimes I just get half way through and then completely run out of things to say. And then I'll sit there and 20 minutes not typing a single word. It's super annoying and a waste of time. I'm also going to change all the titles to the word <strong>Daily</strong>. The goal this week is to not miss a day. Now that I'm writing here more, I need to get back to continuing to build out this website. I think my first page will be a massive assortment of links to news websites. But I'm going to start with Mexico. I will probably start with national press and then go state by state. Next step being to scrap every single one of them into a database. But that is a ways a way. I want to use Python for all that stuff and haven't touch Python in over a year so yeah haha. I've been really craving though getting back to it lately. I don't know why. I just don't have the time at the moment to dedicate to it and honestly need to continue smacking away at JavaScript for the time being.</p>
