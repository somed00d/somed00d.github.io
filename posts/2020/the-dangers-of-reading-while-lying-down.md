I have this really bad habit of lying down on the couch to read. When mentioning this to a doctor a couple years ago his response was, "The bed is for two things, sleeping and having sex." At the time I didn't have a couch so I was lying down on my bed to read. I spend all day at my computer and throughout I need breaks, nothing unusual. My breaks usually consist of me reading on my iPad, either news articles or books. This is a horrible habit because it makes me tired. Which in turn makes me get sleepier than I potentially am. Then this weird brainwashing occurs where I convince myself that it's okay to take a miniature nap. Bad idea. The reason I tell you this is because I was laying down on the couch reading before this. And that brain washing was starting to kick in. At one point a while back I was trying to train myself to take like 15-30 minute naps but not really fully fall asleep. I don't even know if this is possible. I think it is. I had read some article that said if you took a nap no longer than 40 minutes or something you were fucked and it would just make you groggy. But if you could master the miniature nap, you'd get actual relief. I think this was all an attempt at that. All probably occurring because of my bad choice of lying down during breaks throughout the day to read or scroll social media. Since I sit at my desk all day, I don't want to sit here and read. I try to not spend too much time sitting at my desk doing just nothing. I'm either trying to get some sort of *work* accomplished or playing video games. Sitting in a chair without a desk and reading requires good posture. I always end up neck down looking at my iPad, which makes my neck hurt. I think laying down provides the best posture. That is probably a lie, it is certainty the most comfortable though. 

See you tomorrow.
