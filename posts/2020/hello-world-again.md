<!-- Excerpt Start -->
We find ourselves in a familiar place again
<!-- Excerpt End -->
I think this is maybe the fourth personal website that I have started. Some have lasted longer than other but none amounted to much. I need another web development project and a place to brain dump. I've gotten [narco.news](https://narco.news) to a place developmentally where it doesn't need much. That gives me time to start something else on the side, albeit much smaller. But as much as I want to use this for development, I also want to use it to start organizing my own knowledge, which will then make it easier for me to build upon that knowledge. My intention is to post a lot here, both long and short about a vast assortment of things that I find interesting. Also not just stuff that is related to computers and criminals but everything. This will sort of be like a long form Twitter for me. But instead of putting that content on Twitter I am going to put it here. For one so that I own it, and second to make it a lot easy to navigate through.
