<!-- Excerpt Start -->
It doesn't feel like Christmas eve
<!-- Excerpt End -->

Finally yesterday my productivity waned. It wasn't so bad though, but I didn't managed to get anything posted. I spent a lot of the afternoon messing around with the design as I'm sure you noticed. Today I haven't done much of any work except some studying in the morning. I'm about a chapter behind in my textbook. The last two chapters have been a real drag but they're the longest ones in the book. Tomorrow doesn't feel like Christmas, I guess that's expected with the year we've had. I don't really know what to expect for next year. Though I'm confident that it'll at least be better than the chaos of this year. I hope it's at least filled with less uncertainty.
