<p>The goal to write every day was made because I knew I would fail doing it. I knew that there would be some days where I just couldn't get it done. And with each one of those failures comes with it a potential learning opportunity. The other goal being to become better at failing. By creating harmless situations in which I knew I would fail. In turn giving me more opportunities to ponder why.</p>
<p>I guess all together creating like some controlled failure environment. Also build consistency and get better at writing. Maybe some people are thinking, &quot;Why doesn't this dude just use a journal?&quot; Well because I need to practice writing that I would post to the Internet. It would be easy to get lazy writing a private journal that no one sees and likely turn into a mess of incoherence. Not to imply that what all this is here isn't. ðŸ˜‰ But right now I'm not worrying so much about the writing <em>writing</em> as much as I am about the practice of taking words from my brain and organizing them onto a piece of paper. And of course get down the every day thing. I think so far I have missed 4 days. I need to start doing them earlier haha, that will help a lot. But you know how it is. I also don't have as much to say early. I like doing them at night. But then it makes it easier to say fuck it if I'm feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Like right now. I typed most of that a couple of hours ago. I was going to finish it but again, you know how that goes. But I missed last night and we can't be missing two nights. I'm running out of things to say. The brain slowly locking up. Or over-thinking. I'm not trying to sit here for another 45 minutes. Ciao.</p>
