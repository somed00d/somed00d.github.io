I wish every day could be as productive as this one
<!-- Excerpt End -->

Yikes! I had a very productive day. But little to say for it. I'm exhausted and didn't want to miss this. So after falling asleep on the couch, here we are. I'm sure I'll have plenty to reflect on tomorrow when we see how productive we are. It will be nice to compare to how today went. I can't really say why today went so well, it just did. Things fell into place and I was able to stay focused. I didn't get off task or allow myself to get distracted. I broke everything up into tomatoes, I did a total of eight which is only four hours of uninterrupted attention, though it felt longer. It's kind of annoying to always be *on the clock* but it surely encourages less procrastination. It kind of creates a fake sense of urgency which is beneficial. One thing I did well today was take solid breaks. I took an hour and a half break over lunch. That helped prevent burn out in the morning and kept me motivated to continue working after lunch. Anyways, we'll see what tomorrow brings.
