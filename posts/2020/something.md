<!-- Excerpt Start -->
I need to write more. Here is the start of that.
<!-- Excerpt End -->

In order to improve my writing, I need to start writing more. That all sounds simple enough. Though I suck at writing. I have never had to write in any official capacity my entire life. Probably the last time I wrote a so-called *paper* was in high school. I didn't get very far in college so no writing happened there. I don't quite know what I will write about, probably my own problems or difficulties. In an effort to get things off my chest. I have never been able to describe effectively how ADHD impacts my life. I want to write more about that. And learning difficulties, depression, anxiety. These things might not interest others, which is totally fine. I really am not looking for reaction or input. Though I appreciate those who lend their own time to offer them. I don't even plan on posting these to my Twitter account, people can just find them. I was thinking the other day how it will be sort of fun to see how long it takes someone to mention something from here to me. I want to try to write every day because really that is the only way to improve. But I know that with me that will be impossible. But I am still going to try anyways. Sometimes I just get so caught up in things that I forget to set time aside for things that are important to me. It's frustrating. I think that is probably a normal problem a lot of people have. Typically the remedy I've heard offered is to get into a routine. Set aside a specific time every single day, morning or night to sit down and write. Sure, that all sounds good. But while my environment is not sporadic, my mind is. I don't know. I can't describe it very well. And when I try to I just over think it, eventually feeling like anything I come up with makes no sense. I think sometimes that is just my own brain playing tricks on me. We are, at the end of the day, our own harshest critics. Add to that an ever longing feeling of under performance and things get fun. My thinking is starting to lock up and I really don't want to spend hours thinking over this. I just want to do it and feel like I've accomplished something.

See you tomorrow.
