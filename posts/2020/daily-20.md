<!-- Excerpt Start -->
It has been a sluggish last couple of days 
<!-- Excerpt End -->

That's to be expected when I've run out of Adderall. Typically, I do fairly well avoiding running out of medication but this time the pharmacy was out of it. Thankfully, that situation taken care of in a couple of days. But it's not only the time without it that throws me off balance. Leading up to having zero, I usually don't have enough to take my typical two-a-day. Depending, it might be a couple of days or a week. Point being, I'm running on half-capacity. And then I run out, for a couple days or a week, and then the refill comes in... finally. It takes about 48 hours for things to balance out, to where I don't feel like I'm doing cocaine. The first week usually feels like a rat race, trying to catch up with everything that I neglected during the sluggish period. Then it's usually smooth sailing from there on and I just feel normal.

My advice for what to do when you run out of your Adderall:

  - Don't panic
  - Take a mini-vacation from work
  - Less computer, more books

It's less than ideal to have a potential multi-day productivity disruption on a monthly basis. It doesn't have to be a disruption though if you see it coming and adjust. Accept that you'll be less productive and don't beat yourself up over it. Either be extra productive before or while not productive prepare yourself for when you become productive again. So that when you're back in the groove, you know what you need to get done. You'll also reduce anxiety by not trying to keep track of everything during unproductivity. Preparation is half the battle.
