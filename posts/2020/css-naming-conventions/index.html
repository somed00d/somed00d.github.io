<p>Thinking about guidelines and conventions</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>Since this website is pretty basic and supposed to be lean I decided that I wouldn't use a front-end framework like I did with <a href="https://narco.news">narco.news</a>. This means that I'll have to write all of the styles myself. At the moment what I've written style wise is the bare minimum in order to provide something. But as this website continues to grow I'll be required to expand on that. This got me thinking and looking for systems and methodologies to design websites. Usually in the past I've been guideline by a framework which takes care of a lot of that decision making for you.</p>
