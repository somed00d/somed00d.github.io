<!-- Excerpt Start -->
A nothing special Monday
<!-- Excerpt End -->

A slow day it has been. The weather was gloomy which made it feel extra slow. I was fairly productive today, at least in one area. In the writing area I'm kind of in a writers block realm which will hopefully become unplugged tomorrow. So I spent most of the day programming. They had some dude on the news tonight talking about how monumental today was with the first vaccines in the country being delivered. He's right, it is a pretty big day even if it doesn't feel like it. I probably won't get the vaccine for a couple of months at least, but I guess that is sooner than some people. They had clips of people getting the vaccine on the news all night. I think people will ask about this period, "Do you remember when they delivered the vaccine?!" The dude on the news imagined some sort of parade for the postal workers are they drove throughout the country delivering the special serum. It does feel like it should be a bigger deal. Though easy to see how the infinite amount of political drama currently around minimizes everything. Christmas doesn't even feel like Christmas haha. My brain is just on vacation from all holidays this year, we'll catch up with all that next year.

10 days till Christmas!
