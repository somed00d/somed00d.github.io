  <!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>Almost there</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>Another typical day here. I spent most of the day studying. I haven't been writing much the last couple of days. I guess partially from focused on other things and feeling it harder to get the words out than usual. Still can't believe that this year is almost over. While I'm not that confident that the world will be all that different in 2021, we'll have at least moved on from 2020. Maybe it'll at least feel like we're on the path to normalcy. I saw an article the other day that talked about the different ways in which the number 21 represents luck. Everyone these days could use some luck so hopefully the author was onto something. I'm trying to keep my expectations high for next year but realistic. It feels like somewhat in the last couple of months things I've been getting more organized. At oppose to the first couple months of the lock down which was just filled with confusion. I know I'll still be stuck at home for the next couple of months. Even when I get back in the work force there is a large possibility it'll be remotely. So I've been trying to very much master the <em>work from home</em> life. It's all been quite an experience. Something completely out of this world. It feels almost at times as if this place isn't even recognizable anymore. But I've hope that it'll come back. Just need to stay patient and keep on keepin' on.</p>
