In the home stretch!

Did pretty well on the productivity front again today. I've been making good progress with my studying, doing about a chapter a day. If all goes well I should be through the thing by the end of the weekend. I've been doing about four hours a day of studying and two hours of review and testing. Breaking it all up into tomatoes has been helping me a lot to stay on task so that's cool. I've been trying to write some stuff for [narco.news](https://narco.news) in the evening but have been hitting a brick wall. For some reason my brain just doesn't want to come up with the right words. I've have trouble even getting past a couple sentences because I start over thinking and rewriting. I definitely need a better technique for drafting because I think I'm spending too much time thinking. I'll have to look at one of my books over the weekend for suggestions. Sometimes I think I would have been a better radio talk show host. I'm better at getting my thoughts out vocally as oppose to through writing. But I think maybe that's not unusual, I never have written much in my life. I do thinking writing these little whatevers does help. I really do want to make them worthwhile though. In due time. I haven't had much to say because I haven't really been paying attention to much other than studying. Only really hoping on Twitter to check certain things but haven't been hanging out. Trying to limit how much *extra* stuff I throw into my brain, I guess in an effort to leave enough space for all the studying. I really need to start doing these before midnight, the evenings have been flying this week though for some reason. We'll see what tomorrow brings, hopefully lots of productivity!
