<p>Today it felt good to <em>not</em> write a lot. After spending so much time the last couple of days writing, it was good to give the brain a break today. I spent the morning studying computer stuff and the afternoon working on some code. I had a mini break through with the website so that was exciting. It was probably three weeks ago now that I was trying to do something. It was driving me nuts because it wouldn't work, but it should have! Like really, it really should have, everything made perfect sense. But for some reason it just wasn't working. Long story short, I was messing around with it today and it worked. ðŸ˜’ I guess it was just one of those <em>things</em>.</p>
<p>It's nice to be able to go program whenever I don't feel like writing and vice versa. I'll try to do them both effectively on the same day and it never works well. It's just one of those mood things maybe as well. Some days I feel like I've got a whole lot to say and other days not so much. Though we mustn't ever forget that sometimes mood doesn't matter. You've just got to grind through the mother fucker. Building <a href="https://narco.news">narco.news</a> gave me a good dose of that lesson. Especially when I was stuck on something that I knew I wasn't going to be able to figure out in a single day. Meaning it would take multiple days of good old fashion defeat before we even got a glimpse at victory. But the funny thing about progress is that it's not always linear. You might go a couple days and make absolute no progress and then boom, something clicks, and you make a ton of progress in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>What's most important is that you sit your ass in that chair every day and take a shot... because you know &lt;INSERT CORNY QUOTE ABOUT MISSING ALL THE SHOTS YOU DON'T TAKE&gt;</p>
