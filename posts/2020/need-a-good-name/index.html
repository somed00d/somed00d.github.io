<p>The fight for me every day is productivity. Whenever I feel I've had a day that was unproductive, I feel like shit. With ADHD this happens quite frequently. Today though I felt pretty productive so I don't feel as bad. I made some progress on a couple of articles I am working on and I spent a lot of the day studying. I signed up for Roam yesterday to help with my studying, we'll see how that goes. The weather was absolutely miserable today but it didn't really bother me. I just kind of stayed in my own world with my headphones on all day. We'll see what tomorrow brings. Thursdays are my unlucky days so fingers crossed!</p>
