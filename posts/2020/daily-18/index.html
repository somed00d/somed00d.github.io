  <!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>Christmas day is here.</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>Like I mentioned yesterday, it doesn't feel like it. But the world doesn't give two fucks about how you <em>feel</em>, Christmas is here. Which means the end of the year is near. I'm already bad with time and dates, this year especially though is just a complete blur. I think we'll save all that ranting for NYE. Today is about Christmas.</p>
<p>One thing that makes Christmas less entertaining is the lack of snow. I grew up in the north with lots and lots of snow every year. So when I think of Christmas, I think of snow. But snow where I'm currently located is hard to come by. Meaning that my Christmas is never filled with snow which sucks. Though it was cold as hell today and we got a lot of rain. But that is far from as exciting as snow. I think if I had all the money in the world I would spend my Christmas' in some place snowy. I can't even imagine having Christmas in some place like Florida where it's always warm. That just sounds wrong! To have a true Christmas, with all the bells and whistles, I think snow is a requirement. Some day I'll get back to that snowy Christmas wonderland. I'm just thankful this year to have all my family healthy. That's saying something with how chaotic this year has been for so many. Here's to next year being a better Christmas!</p>
