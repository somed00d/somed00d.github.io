<p>It's funny how that works...</p>

<p>We're now only a couple weeks from the end of the year, if that's what you can even call it. It certainly didn't feel like a year. It kind of blows my mind sometimes when I think about how I've sat here in this chair for the majority of it. I remember at first thinking it was just going to be like some temporary disruption. Maybe like a long temporary disruption but it was hard to comprehend how things were changing permanently right in front of our eyes. For me it has been a bit of <em>be careful what you wish for.</em> I had been working at the same job for last couple of years and it had begun winding down over the past year. I knew that at some point I was going to have to take time to figure out what my next move would be. It'd been hard making that transition while still having to devote a good amount of energy to my current job. Then comes the pandemic, when the lock down hit the country my job went poof. Now given an infinite amount of time to sit here and work on that transition. It's been a slower process than I would have liked but so be it. I'm finally beginning to feel like <a href="https://narco.news">narco.news</a> is getting to a point of completion developmentally. I think I've said this multiple times but this time I really mean it. The two things that needed to be done were internationalization and the ability to have different sections of the home page be organized based on certain tags. That would prevent everything from being all mixed in together. The reasoning for this is that some of the posts aren't as relevant. I wanted the ability to document topic related articles from other websites and significant organized crime related events. But I didn't want these two kinds of posts to be mixed in with all the other ones. Until I was able to do that I still felt like there needed to be work done. Because I didn't want the website to just be a bunch of interesting articles from the Internet but also not just a bunch of stuff from me either. I really want it to be a mixture of everything, with stuff from many different places. Now that the website can accommodate many different kinds of posts, I can really start focusing on content.</p>
<p>The second part of the transition is getting some computer accreditations. I've learned a lot in the last couple years at my last job but a lot of it was not always in an official capacity. While going through the process of updating my resume I need to get some certs to reflect my updated skill set. It's not as fun or as exciting as building the website and thus has received less attention. If I can get the first one completed before the New Year I'll be thrilled. It will give me good momentum going into the new year and towards getting the follow up ones.</p>
<p>So when I think back over this year, I kind of got what I wanted. Which is being stuck at home so I could build <a href="https://narco.news">narco.news</a> and work on building my resume up for my next career adventure. It just so happened that it'd all be because of some fucking pandemic.</p>
