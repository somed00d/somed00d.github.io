  <!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>I figure while I got something on my mind, I might as well write it out. By the time night comes, I will have completely lost it.</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>Do you wear headphones while you work? I've gone back and forth over the years. But lately I've been wearing headphones every time I sit down at my computer to work. I think it's really helping me stay focused and keep myself on task. It's maybe not so much the music that helps as it is the fact that I can't hear anything else. I can't even hear myself typing this. It's like having a mute button on the world and only choosing to unmute it when you feel something is worth your attention. It eliminates any chance that some random noise is going to throw your attention off.</p>
<p>Normally your brain is pretty good at deciding what is relevant and what is just <em>noise.</em> It knows to ignore sounds that don't present an immediate danger, like a car driving by, a dog barking, or a siren far away. But it still has to make those decisions, even if they happen subconsciously without you knowing it. I think that whole process is a little less fluid with ADHD folk. Even if the car driving by doesn't present a danger, it might still be a relevant event worthy of paying attention too. It rarely is, but my ADHD brain is always asking this question. It's hard for me to entirely disregard it.</p>
<p>I'm a believer that our brains can only hold a finite amount of information every day. That daily box we fill with all sorts of things. Conversations with people close and far. Advertisements we heard on the radio or watched on TV. Some of these things we have control over if they enter into our brains or not. We either choose to turn on the television that day or we do not. But others we don't have as much control over. I can't control when a siren goes off or a car decides to drive in front of my house.</p>
<p>The headphones though eliminate that. Because I cannot hear, I have no knowledge of what is going on outside of my visual purview. That sound information doesn't even enter into my brain. It isn't even given the opportunity to make those decisions.</p>
<p>Now, it must be said that this isn't necessarily <em>safe</em> if you do not live in a safe area. It is important for your own safety to hear what is going on around you. This is why you shouldn't wear headphones when you drive a car. As it's important to not only be able to see what is going on around you but hear as well. I live in a very uneventful neighborhood at the end of a cul-de-sac. So fortunately these aren't concerns of mine but it needs to be said.</p>
<p>Lastly, the importance of music choice must be noted. You need to find something that you don't have to mess with. You will loose benefit if you're always changing the music. So find music that you can set and forget. Also find music that is without advertisements because those are just going to fuck you up too. Depending on my mood, I will go for either electronic, classical, or a mixture.</p>
<p>The best electronic music I've found for this is from a Russian radio station called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Record">Radio Record</a>. They never have advertisements and have dozens of radio stations of different electronic genres to choose from. I typically listen to the main one. The good thing about this music is that you can't listen to it and not feel more energetic, it's hype music. Which is also great for getting through things that you have zero interest of doing.</p>
<p>For classic music, I always go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WQXR-FM">WQXR</a>. Which is a public radio station out of New Jersey but it's more focused on New York City. Being that a lot of the best classic music in the country comes out of New York City, it only makes sense that their classic music radio station would be the best. They also have an opera station called <a href="https://www.wqxr.org/blogs/operavore/">Operavore</a>. What's great is that both stations will broadcast live concerts from the city. That didn't happen as much with COVID but in normal times it's great.</p>
<p>For mixture, I enjoy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIP_(radio_station)">FIP</a>, a radio station from France. They have a good variety and seem to magically always have the mood right. Their other stations are also great if you don't like what's on the main one, and it's all ad-free!</p>
<p>This all is what works for me. I think it also helps get me into the right mindset. Whenever I'm just hanging out at the computer, I don't wear headphones. But if I'm in working mode, then headphones it is.</p>
