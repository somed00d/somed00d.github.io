They say it's hardest right before it gets easyâ€”I hope *they* are right. I'm still fighting my way through this whole studying for the computer certification gig. And the last couple days of material has been rough. I haven't enjoyed a second of it and been getting beat the fuck up by the end-of-chapter quizzes. But, that's just the way it goes. I can't allow myself to get discouraged. I know if I just keep studying that things will click. My goal to take the test was January 1, but I knew I wouldn't make that. I'm hoping in another week and I'll be ready to go. I've gotten through the thick of it in terms of material. The last couple of chapters are less dense and I expect I'll be through them in the next three days. Then I'll spend the rest of the time reviewing and going through lots of practice questions. Slowly but surely.
