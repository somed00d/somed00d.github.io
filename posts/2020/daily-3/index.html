<p>I should probably not write this so late...</p>

<p>Well, it looks like we'll need to get <em>accommodations</em> because I need more time. I'm not waiting a month if that is how long it will take, hopefully it won't. I'm not going to fret about it. I've reduced a lot of anxiety by just taking the practice, realizing I need more time and need to look over certain sections. It's all pretty typical for me, I never succeed at something the first time. In fact, I usually bomb it, get pissed off, feel like an idiot, and then grind my way back to not feel like an idiot. The grind builds character. Other than that, today wasn't bad. The sun was shining, we put Christmas lights up on the house. I pulled out some books that I had about writing. It was pretty funny to look at some of them that are pretty old, like from early high school. They are really basic which is just what I need. I think one thing that stuck out to me the most was the emphasis on the process. I have no process. But I am working on it. Understanding that the first time you write something, it's going to be horrible, and that you revise and revise. They write in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writers-INC-Student-Handbook-Learning/dp/0669529958">Writers Inc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing almost always work best when it springs from the discoveries you make <em>during</em> the writing process</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding two quotes from authors that I think further explain this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The inspiration comes while you write&quot; – Madeleine L'Engle</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I think one is constantly startled by the things that appear before you on the page while you write.&quot; – Ramond Chandler</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For my case, I would swap out inspiration with investigation. I've found that I start seeing and thinking of all sorts of things when I start writing. This isn't the best example because with an investigation, you're suppose to do the investigating before you go write about it. But I guess maybe I would compare it to how a detective takes a bunch of notes, lays out the bulletin board and starts connecting the dots. That is what writing makes it easier for me to do.</p>
<p>This leads me to another quote from the book</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is no such thing as good writing, only good rewriting.&quot; – Louis D. Brandeis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically though, these will never get rewrites. Right now they're just going with the flow to practice getting thoughts out of my head and onto paper.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
