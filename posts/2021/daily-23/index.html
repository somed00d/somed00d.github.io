<p>Consistent productivity</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>An article posted today to HN titled <a href="https://matthewsaltz.wordpress.com/2020/11/24/a-simple-and-dynamic-method-for-consistent-productivity/"><em>A Simple and Dynamic Method for Consistent Productivity</em></a> brings about a lot of thoughts. I think one of my biggest problems in relation to productivity is consistency. I will be either really productive or not productive at all, there usually isn't any middle ground. Part of the idea of writing every single day is an attempt to be more consistent in my productivity. And with that consistency is the hope that it will encourage consistency in other areas as well. Part of all this is coming up with strategies that allow you to be more consistent. His strategy that he puts forth is to begin your day by choosing a single goal that you can accomplish that day and that the accomplishment is worthwhile. That if you only completed all week your single task each day, you would feel productive. He also mentions the importance of what I call, <em>obsessive focus.</em> Which means you're obsessed and extremely mindful of your focus in that moment. You can't be obsessively focused all day long, it only works in short bursts. He mentions that his goals will usually take one to two hours of focused effort. That doesn't mean all at once, but that for two hour you are doing absolutely nothing else in the entire world but breathing and focusing on that task.</p>
<p>This fits well with the Pomodoro technique. The goal being that for those 25 minutes you obsessively focus on whatever it is your doing.  Those two hours would equate to four tomatoes. What typically happens is that from accomplishing this single task it encourages further productivity because you're riding high from just getting something of value done. It helps to reduce starting anxiety and the feeling of being overwhelmed. I think sometimes To-Do lists can become overwhelming when they're overloaded. You look at everything you have to do and don't even know where to start. So I really appreciate his technique of only writing down a single thing at a time, crossing it off when you're finished, and then writing down the next thing. I'm getting to a point where I almost can't be productive when I'm not doing a tomato. I just wrote all of this within a single tomato. And I know if I hadn't set that timer that it would have taken me longer. I wouldn't have been in the zone as much. I wouldn't have felt accountable for my time. Whenever I convince myself that I don't need to set the timer to accomplish Thing X because it won't take me <em>that</em> long, I'm always proved wrong. I got about three minutes left, time to proof read. See you tomorrow!</p>
