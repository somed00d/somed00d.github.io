  <!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>This year will be better.</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>I had started to write something last night around 10:00 p.m. but it just sounded depressing. So I stopped and went to read a book. Right now I'm reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stars_My_Destination"><em>The Stars My Destination</em></a>. Eventually I fell asleep, waking up around 4 a.m. Holidays are weird for me now that I'm sober. I don't do what <em>normal</em> people do. I had moved out of the city about a year before the pandemic and so I'm also away from friends. Though to be honest, I probably wouldn't have hung out with them if I was near. I've been feeling increasingly reclusive in the last two years and the pandemic has just encouraged all that. But it's really not as fun being <em>stuck</em> at home. Like it's one thing to be an introvert out in the world, it's another thing to be an introvert stuck at home. At the same time I can't deny the positive changes that have been brought about because I've been stuck at home. Things that probably wouldn't have happened had I not been stuck at home. That is why it's hard to put into words what this year means. At face value, it's a complete clusterfuck. But who knows, maybe in a couple years, many will look back and say that it's because of the pandemic that they've gotten to where they're at. It is easier I think to see how good things have gotten us to where we're at but more difficult to see how bad things have. Or maybe easier to admit to ourselves. What has more of an impact on your path in life? Is it the bad things that lead to the good or the good things that lead to the bad? For without bad, do we even know what good is? I don't know. Those questions are out of my pay grade. I think ultimately the thought is that this year was confusing, very confusing.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with the words of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus">Epictetus</a>, from a chapter in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Human-Freedom-Penguin-Great-Ideas-ebook/dp/B003ZUXX60"><em>Of Human Freedom</em></a>. It is titled <em>Every circumstance represents an opportunity</em> and I think it gets at this stuff of good and bad somewhat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just about everyone agrees that 'good' or 'bad' in the case of objective judgments applies to us, not to things outside us. No one calls 'good' the fact that it is day, or 'bad' that it is night, or 'the greatest of evils' that three is equal to four. No, they call correct judgment bad –⁠ the consequence being that good even comes of error, when we recognize the error as such.</p>
<p>And so it should be in life. 'Being healthy is good, being sick is bad.' No, my friend: enjoying health in the right way is good; making bad use of your health is bad. 'So even illness can benefit us?' Why not, if even death and disability can? It was no small advantage Menoeceus derived from his dying, after all. 'Whoever says so is welcome to the same advantages!' Come, by his sacrifice didn't he save himself –⁠ that is, the patriot in him, the benefactor, the man of honor, the man of his word –⁠ all of whom would have died had he survived? Conversely, he would have acquired the reputation for being timid, mean, treacherous, and weak.</p>
<p>Well –⁠ do you think his death did him hardly any good? I suppose the father of Admetus greatly enjoyed living on such base and despicably terms, who afterwards died all the same. For God's sake, stop honoring externals, quit turning yourself into the tool of mere matter, or of people who can supply you or deny you those material things. So is it possible to benefit from these circumstances? Yes, from every circumstance, even abuse and slander. A boxer derives the greatest advantage from his sparring partner –⁠ and my accuser is my sparring partner. He trains me in patience, civility and even temper. I mean, a doctor who puts me in a headlock and sets a dislocated pelvis or shoulder –⁠ he benefits me, however painful the procedure. So too does a trainer when he commands me to 'lift the weight with both hands' –⁠ and the heavier it is, the greatest benefit to me.</p>
<p>Well, if someone trains me to be even-tempered, am I not benefited in that case? This shows you do not know how to be helped by your fellow man. I have a bad neighbor –⁠ bad, that is, for himself. For me, though, he is good: he exercises my power of fairness and sociability. A bad father, likewise, is bad for himself, but for me represents a blessing. The wand of Hermes promises that 'whatever you touch will turn to gold.' For my part, I can say: bring illness, death, poverty, slander, a judgment of death: they will all be converted to advantage by my wand of Hermes.'</p>
<p>'What good will you get from death?'
'I will make it your glory, or the occasion for you to show how a person obeys the will of nature.'
'What will you make of illness?'
'I will expose its true nature by outdoing myself in calmness and serenity; I will neither beg the doctor's help, nor pray for death. What more could you ask? Everything, you see, that you throw at me I will transform into a blessing, a boon –⁠ something dignified, even enviable.</p>
<p>But no. Instead you say, 'Be careful that you don't get ill: it's bad.' Which is like saying, 'Guard against ever entertaining the idea that three is equivalent to four: it's bad.' How is it bad? If I weight the statement correctly, what harm can it do to me? It is more likely to help. Similarly, it is enough if I hold the right idea about poverty, illness, and removal from office: all such challenges will only serve my turn. No more, then should I look for bad, and good, in external conditions.</p>
<p>Ah, but these principles never leave the school, no one takes them with him when he goes back home. Instead, war immediately breaks out –⁠ with your slave, your neighbors, with people who scoff at these principles and make fun of you. For my part, I bless Lesbios for daily reminding me that I know nothing.</p>
