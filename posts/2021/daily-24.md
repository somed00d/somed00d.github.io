Yikes!

The irony is that after the last post, I was going to talk about not getting distracted by irrelevant things that don't directly affect you. Because these days the distractions are plentiful. I had exhausted a lot of energy last Sunday working through my latest article for [narco.news](https://narco.news) and took a little breather. And then BOOM, incoming clown coup. Which has been a holy grail of a distraction. It's been some time since I've seen the entirety of Twitter caught up in a single subject. Even over the summer, not *everyone* was focused on protests. Sure, there was international attention but I don't know, Wednesday felt like it got more attention. I think a lot of what attributed to this being such a juicy distraction is that it was riddled with uncertainty. If I am certain of an outcome, I'm less likely to get distracted. It's when I'm uncertain that I can't take my eyes off it. The curiosity of what could happen made it all more tempting.

That's one tomato. And I'm not spending more time on this tonight. See ya.
